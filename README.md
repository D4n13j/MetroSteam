# Metro skin for Steam chat and friends UI

This skin for the new chat and friends UI was created after Valve made it problematic to revert to the old-style windows.
My quest was to make the new windows look as close as possible to those of [the original Metro skin](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/metroforsteam).

## Installation
### Windows
* [Download](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SteamFriendsPatcher/releases) the latest patcher or its [older version](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/EnableNewSteamFriendsSkin/releases) to allow for customization.
* Save the [friends.custom.css file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoseTheFlower/newsteamchat/master/friends.custom.css) to your PC and put in your Steam\clientui\ folder.
* Launch the patcher and wait for it to apply the changes.
* Close and open the chat and friends windows if necessary.
### Linux and Mac
* Copy and add the [friends.custom.css code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoseTheFlower/newsteamchat/master/friends.custom.css) to Steam/skins/[skin name]/resource/webkit.css
* Search the file contents for *Linux* or *Mac* in any text editor.
* Remove sections as instructed within the code.

## Help and options
The [wiki](https://github.com/RoseTheFlower/newsteamchat/wiki) answers some of the most asked questions and contains a few extras.

## Uninstallation
### Windows
* Simply remove friends.custom.css from Steam\clientui\
