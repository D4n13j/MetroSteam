# Metro skin for Steam

This skin for the new UI framework was created after Valve made it problematic to revert to the old-style windows and subsequently removed support for user-made themes.
My quest was to make the windows look as close as possible to those of [the original Metro skin](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/metroforsteam).

## Installation
1. Go to your Steam\steamui\css folder and ensure there is no library.css file.
1. [Download the skin archive](/../../archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
1. Extract the archive to **Steam\steamui\skins** (create the skins folder if doing this for the first time).
   - If you like, rename the MetroSteam-master folder to `Metro by Rose`.
1. [Download](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SFP/releases) the latest version of SFP to modify Steam.
1. Run the tool and select the skin under *Steam skin* in its settings.
1. In SFP, click on Start Injection unless already done.

## Extra options
- If you'd like to customize the colors, decals and more, edit custom.css in any text editor as desired.
- Check out the [wiki](../../wiki) to enable automatic skin updates or learn more about customizing the skin.
