# Metro skin for Steam

This skin for the new UI framework was created after Valve made it problematic to revert to the old-style windows and subsequently removed support for user-made themes.
My quest was to make the windows look as close as possible to those of [the original Metro skin](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/metroforsteam).

## Installation
1. Go to your Steam\steamui\css\ folder and ensure there is no library.css file.
1. Save the [friends and chat skin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoseTheFlower/newsteamchat/master/friends.custom.css) to your PC and put in your Steam\steamui\ folder.
1. Save the [library skin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoseTheFlower/newsteamchat/master/libraryroot.custom.css) to your PC and put in your Steam\steamui\ folder.
1. [Download](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/SFP/releases) the latest version of SFP to modify Steam.
1. Run the tool alongside Steam and wait for it to apply the changes.
1. Restart Steam if necessary.

## Extra options
- If you'd like to customize the colors, decals and more, also download [custom.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoseTheFlower/newsteamchat/master/custom.css) and put in the same folder as the rest of the files, then edit this file in any text editor as desired.
- Check out the [wiki](../../wiki) to enable automatic skin updates or learn more about customizing the skin.
