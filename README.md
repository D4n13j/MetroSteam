# Good old Metro skin for the new Steam chat and friends UI

This skin for the new chat and friends UI was created after Valve made it problematic to revert to the old-style windows.
My quest was to make the new windows look as close as possible to those of [the original Metro skin](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/metroforsteam).


Known issues seemingly applicable to all skins:
* Broken height of multiuser chats
* Alignment issues at the notification options tab

Credits:
* **[RedSigma](https://github.com/redsigma)** for creating a custom skin of the new chat, which I initially used as a template.
* **[PhantomGamers](https://github.com/PhantomGamers)** for creating [the tool](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/EnableNewSteamFriendsSkin/) that makes customization possible.
* **[Shiina](https://github.com/AikoMidori)** for helping me find a few elements and for making me realize where to look.
* **[Ruben7173](https://github.com/Ruben7173/)** for pointing at an element and for inspiring me to implement custom scroll bar buttons.
