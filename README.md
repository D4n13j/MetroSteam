# Metro skin for new Steam chat and friends UI

This skin for the new chat and friends UI was created after Valve made it problematic to revert to the old-style windows.
My quest was to make the new windows look as close as possible to those of [the original Metro skin](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/metroforsteam).

## Installation
* [Download](https://github.com/PhantomGamers/EnableNewSteamFriendsSkin/releases) the latest patcher to allow for customization.
* Save the [.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoseTheFlower/newsteamchat/master/friends.custom.css) to your PC and put in your Steam/clientui/ folder.
* Launch the patcher and wait for it to apply the changes.
* Close and open the chat and friends windows if necessary.

## Credits
* [RedSigma](https://github.com/redsigma) for creating a custom skin of the new chat, which I initially used as a template.
* [PhantomGamers](https://github.com/PhantomGamers) for creating the tool that makes customization possible.
* [Shiina](https://github.com/AikoMidori) for helping me find a few elements and for making me realize where to look.
* [Ruben7173](https://github.com/Ruben7173/) for pointing at an element and for inspiring me to implement custom scroll bar buttons.
